# Using Git
- Go to your repo folder by cd (change directory) [repo name]
- use mikdr to make a directory in that repository
- go into your directory using cd command
- write code [file name] (like code palindrome.py) - This will open VS Code
- Code there and save
- Use git add . to update changes
- use git commit -m "message" to commit
- Use git push to push it onto your Github
- For markdown, you can create a new file in vs code, name is README.md and save it in your directory
- then you need to add, commit and push

  ## ALL DONE ðŸ¥³
